<p>
	<em>Premium Services.</em>
	Many of useafireman.com's premium services use an order form for you to subscribe to the premium content on the site and/or to receive our free email
	newsletter. We collect a customer's contact information and, in some cases, credit card information to bill the subscriber for these optional services. All
	other areas of our sites are offered free of charge.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Anonymous Information.</em>
	useafireman.com may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by useafireman.com or shared with third parties. This is information which does
	not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally this information is
	collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "cookies," "IP addresses," or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Cookies.</em>
	useafireman.com employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on the Web site, as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept
	cookies from the domain (e.g. "godaddy.com") cannot access most areas of useafireman.com's Web site. We use an advertising server developed by a third
	party, <a href="https://www.adaptivem.com">https://www.adaptivem.com</a> , to display ads on our site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set
	by third parties (i.e., advertising agencies or advertising clients). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain.
	Acceptance of cookies from domains other than useafireman.com is optional.
</p>
<p>
	<em>IP Addresses.</em>
	useafireman.com also logs IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. (Your IP address indicates the location of your computer on
	the Internet). We do not log IP addresses to track your session, nor do we link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Credit Card Information.</em>
	If you use a credit card to pay for a useafireman.com subscription, we will continue to charge your account for the length of the subscription term or
	until you cancel. If you give us credit card information for any other purpose or to pay for any other type of purchase, it will be used one time only to
	fulfill one order, and useafireman.com will not store your credit card information.

	<strong>What does useafireman.com do with the information it gathers and/or tracks?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<em>Statistical Analysis and Banner Advertising.</em>
	useafireman.com may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development
	purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. useafireman.com also uses demographic
	information to allow advertising banners on our Web site to be targeted, in aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. This means that
	readers see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving
	both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. In this statistical analysis and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose
	information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal information about you as an individual subscriber or registrant will not be provided to any
	third party, except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, as described in our Terms and Conditions of Use.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	Occasionally, useafireman.com shares data collected about subscribers with other units within the useafireman.com group of companies or third parties whose
	products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Many of our subscribers find these mail or email promotions valuable, whether they are shopping for
	merchandise, taking advantage of a special offer or purchasing unique services. If you prefer not to receive promotional materials from companies outside
	the useafireman.com group of companies, please see the "Opting Out" provision below.
